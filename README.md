# Real-Time-Data-Synchronization-and-Performance-Benchmarking-Between-PostgreSQL-and-CrateDB
Set up CrateDB with 5 related tables and loaded ~100K records each. Imported a PostgreSQL snapshot into CrateDB to compare query performance. Implemented real-time data sync from PostgreSQL to CrateDB to maintain consistency, enabling fast analytics on live transactional data.
